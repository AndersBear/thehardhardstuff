   <b>non-deterministic</b>:  unpredictable;  when the same input is used for two or more separate calls to the same function,

    <b>similitude</b>:  a homothety that leaves the origin fixed; in vector terms, a transformation x &#8594 kx
    where k is a positive number (the ratio of similitude) and the origin is the center of similitude.
    Two figures related by such a transformation are homothetic.<br><br>

  <div class="smallboxed"><br>
   <b>therapeutic index</b>:  a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity; 
   a drug with a narrow therapeutic index can cause a detrimental effect when the dose is raised only slightly higher than the 
   therapeutic dose;  a drug with a wide therapeutic index can be dosed much higher than the therapeutic dose without causing
   a stronger effect<br><br> 
   <b>threshold</b>:  a point at which tolerance changes;  breaking point<br><br>
   <b>transformation</b>:  a change in position, scale, rotation, orientation, etc.;  sometimes simply called a "transform", in computer 
   graphics: "to apply a transform"<br><br>

     &nbsp;&nbsp;"The operational principle of the model may now be succinctly stated: <i>the regulatory-protein mosaic is an adaptor made of separate pieces, a 
     <b>multiplex adaptor</b>.  On one end, the multiplex plugs into the DNA and, on the other, into the RNA polymerase.  Information about the location
     of the start of transcriptional units flows into the multiple plug-ins at the various promoter and enhancer sites, and is relayed from
     protein to protein in the adaptor mosaic, to finally converge on the RNA polymerase.</i><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the why and wherefore of the solid-state apparatus of the genes."<br><br>

     "In normal times, the movement of rain water downward through the mat lowers its salinity and assists
     the growth of photosynthesizers at the surface, the primary providers of food and energy for the communities
     beneath.  Salt crystals at, or near, the surface are also coated with their own specific varnish and
     protected against easy solution in rain water."<br><br>

      "We have, namely, good ground for the assumption that the 'field-free' Minkowski-space represents a special case possible in natural law, 
      in fact, the simplest conceivable special case.  With respect to its metrical character, such a space is characterized by the fact that
      dx<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> is the square of the spatial separation, measured with a 
      unit gauge, of two infinitesimally neighbouring points of a three-dimensional 'space-like' cross section (Pythagorean theorem), whereas
      dx<sub>4</sub> is the temporal separation, measured with a suitable time gauge, of two events with common (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>).
      All this simply means that an objective metrical significance is attached to the quantity<br><br>
      ds<sup>2</sup> = dx<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> - dx<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup> <br><br> 
      as is readily shown with the aid of the Lorentz transformations.  Mathematically, this fact corresponds to the condition that ds<sup>2</sup> 
      is invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations."<br><br>
      ~  Albert Einstein,  "Relativity"<br><br>
      So what does this mean in plain English?  "temporal" has to do with time.  "an objective metrical significance" ?  Is time objective or subjective?
      How much does time matter in these calculations?  (It is the only variable being subtracted.) ? <br><br>

      trying to determine the sizes of particles:<br>
      "It is especially important to note that with a standard Lorentz transformation the 
      width of the photon perpendicular to its propagation direction will be preserved under all 
      changes in the observer coordinate system. Thus, the width of a photon will be the same in any coordinate system."<br>
