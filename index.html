     &nbsp;&nbsp;"The operational principle of the model may now be succinctly stated: <i>the regulatory-protein mosaic is an adaptor made of separate pieces, a 
     <b>multiplex adaptor</b>.  On one end, the multiplex plugs into the DNA and, on the other, into the RNA polymerase.  Information about the location
     of the start of transcriptional units flows into the multiple plug-ins at the various promoter and enhancer sites, and is relayed from
     protein to protein in the adaptor mosaic, to finally converge on the RNA polymerase.</i><br>

      "We have, namely, good ground for the assumption that the 'field-free' Minkowski-space represents a special case possible in natural law, 
      in fact, the simplest conceivable special case.  With respect to its metrical character, such a space is characterized by the fact that
      dx<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> is the square of the spatial separation, measured with a 
      unit gauge, of two infinitesimally neighbouring points of a three-dimensional 'space-like' cross section (Pythagorean theorem), whereas
      dx<sub>4</sub> is the temporal separation, measured with a suitable time gauge, of two events with common (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>).
      All this simply means that an objective metrical significance is attached to the quantity<br><br>
      ds<sup>2</sup> = dx<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> - dx<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup> <br><br> 
      as is readily shown with the aid of the Lorentz transformations.  Mathematically, this fact corresponds to the condition that ds<sup>2</sup> 
      is invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations."<br><br>
      ~  Albert Einstein,  "Relativity"<br><br>
      So what does this mean in plain English?  "temporal" has to do with time.  "an objective metrical significance" ?  Is time objective or subjective?
      How much does time matter in these calculations?  (It is the only variable being subtracted.) ? <br><br>
