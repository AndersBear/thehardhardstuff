   E = mc<sup>2</sup><br><br>
   Einstein's equation,<br><br>
   Energy = mass * the speed of light squared<br><br>
   from Newton's equation:<br><br>
   F = ma<br><br>
   Force = mass * acceleration<br><br>
   These are easy formulas, but think about <i>before</i> they were known by anyone.<br><br>

  <div class="smallboxed"><br>
   <b>idempotent</b>:  unchanged when multiplied by itself;  equal to its own square;  an idempotent operation 
   has no additional effect if it is called more than once with the same input<br><br>
   The matrix<br>
   [ 2 &nbsp; 2]<br>
   [-1 -1]<br>  
   is idempotent.<br><br>
   
   Set-theoretic intersection and union are idempotent,
   because <br>
   S âˆª S = S = S âˆ© S <br><br>

   <b>mutex</b>:  mutual exclusion lock;  only one thread or user can hold the lock, thereby preventing concurrent access to the mutexed resource<br><br>
  </div><br><br>

  <div class="smallboxed"><br>
   <b>non-deterministic</b>:  unpredictable;  when the same input is used for two or more separate calls to the same function,
   non-determinism can cause unpredictable output, due to concurrent access or the use of randomness, see <i>mutex</i> to prevent this<br><br>

    <b>reverse engineering</b>:  taking apart somethin in order to understand how it works<br><br>
   </div><br><br>  


  <div class="smallboxed"><br>
   <b>therapeutic index</b>:  a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity; 
   a drug with a narrow therapeutic index can cause a detrimental effect when the dose is raised only slightly higher than the 
   therapeutic dose;  a drug with a wide therapeutic index can be dosed much higher than the therapeutic dose without causing
   a stronger effect<br><br>
  </div><br><br>  

  <div class="smallboxed"><br>
   <b>threshold</b>:  a point at which tolerance changes;  breaking point<br><br>

   <div class="smallboxed"><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;"The operational principle of the model may now be succinctly stated: <i>the regulatory-protein mosaic is an adaptor made of separate pieces, a 
     <b>multiplex adaptor</b>.  On one end, the multiplex plugs into the DNA and, on the other, into the RNA polymerase.  Information about the location
     of the start of transcriptional units flows into the multiple plug-ins at the various promoter and enhancer sites, and is relayed from
     protein to protein in the adaptor mosaic, to finally converge on the RNA polymerase.</i><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the why and wherefore of the solid-state apparatus of the genes."<br><br>

     "In normal times, the movement of rain water downward through the mat lowers its salinity and assists
     the growth of photosynthesizers at the surface, the primary providers of food and energy for the communities
     beneath.  Salt crystals at, or near, the surface are also coated with their own specific varnish and
     protected against easy solution in rain water."<br><br>
